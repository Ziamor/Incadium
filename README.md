# Incadium
Incadium is a roguelike game I am working on for both desktop and Android. I'm primarily  using this as a learning experience  with using an Entry Component System Architecture.

# Features

-Lights, in differnt colors too!

-Randomly generated maps

-Pathfinding AI using Dijkstra Map, all enemy entites share a common map so that pathfinding only has to be calculated once per frame instead of once for each enemy

-Bitmasked walls in 8 directions
